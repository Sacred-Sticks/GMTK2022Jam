I've setup a baseline health system, good for players and enemies, as well as a damage system.
I've got movement, bullets, enemy jumpers, and enemy shooters complete.
The dice rolling system has a baseline done, you can click to roll. I think it would be better if it was power based,
either with a charge bar on the UI or maybe swiping with the mouse to throw it softer / harder.
I've begun setting up the modifiers that the dice control, the speed and health modifiers should be entirely done.
I'll be spending a lot of saturday working on assets such as a main character (most likely a robot), enemies
(likely robots) and some platforms and such. I won't have time to work on sound,as after I finish the models I plan on 
focusing the rest of the day on UI and building some levels.
